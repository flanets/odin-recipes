This is my first project.  It will include recipes. This project will demonstrate my HTML skills.  

Here are the commands used so far:

git remote -v
This will display the URL of the repository I created in GitHub. which is the remote for my local copy.

touch (to create a new file)

git status (to show the status of the files in the current folder)

git add (to add the file to the staging area)
The staging area is part of two-step process for making a commit to Git (I think of the staging area as a "waiting room" for my changes until I commit them).
